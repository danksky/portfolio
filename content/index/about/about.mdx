Since high school, I've been making apps of all sizes. When Android and iOS apps were all the rage, I made a homework prioritizing app, which amassed tens of thousands of downloads, teaching me a lesson or two about building for scale.

Then I went to college at USC, keen on becoming a biomedical engineer. I found that I could more readily engage with nature and technology by pursuing a Computer Science degree, so I went ahead and did that. I got to tinker with VR in the same Mixed Reality Lab where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey#Early_life"><Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Oculus' inventor, himself, tinkered.</Underlining></a> I also started to think about <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>computing for social good.</Underlining>

Now I work on <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>IBM Cloud</Underlining>, building robust backend systems for high-impact services running in public and private cloud.
